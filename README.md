# Description
This script will ensure that any time you blink outside of the normal blink range,
you will do a maximum distance blink instead of the shorter distance blink that
normally happens.

# Installation
Simply add `hake-me/Max-Blink-Range` to its own line in `repos.txt` then tell the 
client to update your scripts.
